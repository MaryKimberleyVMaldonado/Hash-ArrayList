## FOREACH
// ForEach loop is used to iterate over elements of arrays and collections.
// Sintax: for (type item : array | collection) { // code block to be executed. }
// The type of the item must match the type of the array or collection.
// The item is a variable that represents the current element in the collection.
// The array or collection is the collection that you want to iterate over.
// The code block is executed for each element in the collection.
// The item is a read-only variable, you cannot change it.
// The item is only accessible within the loop.
// The array or collection is only accessible within the loop.
// The loop continues until all elements have been processed.
// The loop can be used with arrays, collections, and strings.
// The loop can be used with break and continue keywords to control the flow.
// The loop can be nested to iterate over two-dimensional arrays or collections.
// The loop can be used with the for-each loop to iterate over arrays and collections.
// The loop can be used with the for-each loop to iterate over arrays and collections.
